However, laws of libel prevent me from writing it here, so instead let me tell you about this book: it&#8217;s very good. Heydon clearly and comprehensively shows you how to use the web <em>properly</em>; that is, how to take advantage of its built-in powers of reach, inclusivity and accessibility, so you don&#8217;t lock out any potential customer or visitor, regardless of how they choose to (or need to) access your content.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been writing about the same for many years, but I&#8217;ve still picked up a number of useful tips and tricks when reading through the drafts. It&#8217;s a little unfortunate that Heydon didn&#8217;t accept some of my amendments to make his musical taste less &mdash; what&#8217;s the word? &mdash; embarrassing, but don&#8217;t let that put you off reading. There&#8217;s a load of useful advice contained in this book, and it would be really good if you were to follow it and make your corner of the web a better place for all. Just tweet <em>me</em> if you want music suggestions.</p><p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk"><span class="link">Bruce Lawson</span></a><sup><a href="#fn3_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup>, Deputy CTO, Opera</p><div class="fn_overview"><p class="separator">â€”</p><p id="fn3_1"><span class="fn_number">1.</span><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk"><span class="fn_link">http://www.brucelawson.co.uk</span></a></p></div></div></body></html>
