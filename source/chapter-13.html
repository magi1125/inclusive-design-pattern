Like many designer-bloggers, I seem to be afflicted with obsessive tinkering and I&#8217;m still not happy with the result. Time is a luxury we often can&#8217;t afford on client projects &mdash; which is why client work sometimes gets finished, I suppose.</p><p>In my opinion, the most effective blog designs are spartan, focusing on content and removing as many distractions as possible. It&#8217;s difficult to overestimate the effect of simplicity on both performance and accessibility. Not incorporating complex and ambitious layouts also puts you on the path to a more robust, flexible reading experience. When the reader adjusts something, there&#8217;s simply less to break as a result.</p><p>Here, we&#8217;ll investigate the composition of an inclusive blog post as found at its permalink, forming the principal content of the parent page. Semantic structure and source order must be taken into account. I&#8217;ll also cover effective link text, incorporating video content, and the creation of an automated <em>flow system</em> to ease the work of content editors.</p><h2>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> Element</h2><p>You may recall the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element from our setup in &#8220;The Document.&#8221; Every web page should have a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element to identify the unique content of that page. The element helps us to think about what the main content of our page actually is, and can later be used as a navigational aid by screen reader operators.</p><p>At a blog permalink, the salient content is the blog article itself, so it should be placed inside <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>. Note the <code>id</code> below, which allows keyboard users to navigate to the article via a skip link (also discussed in &#8220;The Document&#8221;):</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>main</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>main</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>When incorporating complex grid systems, we tend to rely heavily on <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-based scaffolding. This may help us to corral the visual structure of the page, but it has no impact on the <em>semantic</em> structure. That is, the following code example is semantically identical to the preceding one. The source code is just more complex.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"grid_50"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

            <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"main_inner"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>In general, I recommend against dealing with third-party grid systems. They&#8217;re typically rather large assets themselves and encourage convoluted, redundant markup. Not only does this produce a larger document to download, but also it can have additional, unpleasant side effects. For example, in testing I&#8217;ve experienced a screen reader producing erroneous output as it struggled to parse a massive DOM.</p><p>If you&#8217;re building a highly complex layout, a grid system may help you. However, <em>you should not be building a highly complex layout</em>. Simple user interfaces are usable interfaces, accessible interfaces, maintainable interfaces, and performant interfaces.</p><p>In print design, where the relative position of grid elements is reliable and consistent, you can rely on juxtaposition to convey meaning and use terminology like, &#8220;the photograph to the right.&#8221; On the responsive web, you don&#8217;t have this luxury. Occasionally, you&#8217;ll still want to put somethings next to some other things, if only to be intensive with the available space. But there&#8217;s no use trying to be exacting. I&#8217;ll talk more about the terseness with which you can <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/flexbox-grid-finesse"><span class="link">create responsive, self-managing grids</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup> using Flexbox in the &#8220;A Filter Widget&#8221; chapter.</p><h2>Heading Structure</h2><p>I&#8217;m concerned we only usually look at HTML semantics in terms of discrete elements providing meaning, and not by looking at their relationships to one another. While it&#8217;s true the element <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> itself provides idiosyncratic behaviors, these benefits can be diminished with improper placement; for example, by using multiple <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> elements on a single page or by using <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to wrap the entire DOM.</p><p>Heading elements in particular derive much of their meaning from their relationships with one another.</p><h3>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> Element</h3><p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element represents your document&#8217;s first-level heading. It is the top heading of the document. At our permalink, it should be the title of the blog article itself. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> text effectively labels the supersection that is the document body, so it&#8217;s not logical to have more than one per page.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>main</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>How To Mark Up Inclusive Blog Articles<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>main</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Like the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> exposes a navigation shortcut for assistive technology users. Both NVDA and JAWS users can press the <em>1</em> key and their screen readers will transport them directly to the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, where &#8220;How To Mark Up Inclusive Blog Articles, heading level one&#8221; will be announced.</p><p>Practically speaking, the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> offer similar functionality, so why employ both? Because not all screen reader users are alike. In <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/screen-reader-strategy-survey"><span class="link">my informal research into screen reader users&#8217; behaviors and preferences</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_2"><span class="sup_link">2</span></a></sup>, some respondents were familiar and comfortable with landmark (region) navigation, but the majority used headings to get around. Providing unobtrusive options for users is sometimes called <em>multimodality</em>. It&#8217;s why we should also provide transcripts alongside video content. More on that shortly.</p><p>A number of survey respondents also professed to navigate documents from element to element, reading from the start to the end using their screen reader&#8217;s down arrow key (or equivalent). Source order is an important dimension of structure and our blog article should make sense read from top to bottom. Though it can be made to look visually compelling either way, it is therefore important not to open an article with its publish date, but with its heading.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- don’t use this --&gt;</span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>main</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>In the first, commented out example, someone navigating by heading using the generic <em>h</em> key would be unaware of the publish date because the screen reader would take them silently past it.</p><p><img src="images/heading_shortcut.png" alt="Shows how heading navigation bypasses section content that precedes sections’ headings." /></p><p>Note that the first structure is unlikely to produce an error in an automated accessibility testing tool. That does not mean the second structure is not preferable. Inclusive design is about appreciating how people really use interfaces, not just fixing technical errors.</p><h3>Subsections</h3><p>When it comes to structure, depth is just as important as source order. By dividing our blog article into subsections, we can describe which parts of it belong to which other parts, building a thematic map or outline. Despite the inclusion of nestable sectioning elements in the HTML5 specification, like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, the only elements currently able to describe depth in an inclusive fashion are <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>. That&#8217;s not to say you shouldn&#8217;t use <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, but the information they provide does not serve this particular purpose. The HTML5 outline algorithm was specified to automate section structure based on sectioning elements, removing the need for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&ndash;<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>. However, it is <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/10/html5-document-outline/"><span class="link">not implemented in any user agent</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_3"><span class="sup_link">3</span></a></sup>, and there&#8217;s no sign it ever will be.</p><p>As stated, our blog article should begin with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. You could stop there, but the lack of further structural information would produce comprehension issues for a broad range of users. You should always aim to divide your content into digestible chunks. That&#8217;s ultimately what HTML is for: forming structure through differentiation.</p><p>To create a subsection within the article, use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. The <code>2</code> in <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> says &#8220;two levels deep,&#8221; or &#8220;one down from the first level.&#8221; Visually, headings are conventionally differentiated by font size: the deeper the level, the smaller the <code>font-size</code>.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">h1 </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 3em<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token selector">h2 </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 2.25em<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token selector">h3 </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5em<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>This is where a lot of developers make a mistake: they choose a heading element which they believe best fits the perceived importance of the section it represents. For example, a developer might choose an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> in place of an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> because they deem the section unimportant and would like to reduce the <code>font-size</code> accordingly. This deceives both visual and non-visual readers because it breaks the perceived structure &mdash; a level has been skipped.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>How To Mark Up Blog Articles<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

The middle subsection is labeled missing." /><br /><em>Missing layers in document structure can be disorienting to users trying to build a mental map of the document.</em></p><p>Some developers handle heading styles separately using CSS classes.

That&#8217;s what it <em>is</em>, after all! Part of inclusion is achieving a parity of experience across different user needs. By managing content visually one way and non-visually another way, you begin to segregate seeing and non-seeing users. A syndicated version of your content, subject to a different style sheet, would diverge in visual structure too.</p><h3>Subtitles</h3><p>Blog articles in which the author has not been able to say everything they want in a title alone sometimes employ subtitles or straplines. This also applies to books&hellip;</p><p>The previous example could be rewritten to take the title &#8220;How To Mark Up Blog Articles&#8221; and the subtitle &#8220;In Seven Simple Steps.&#8221; The question is how to mark this up. I&#8217;ve seen many an implementation which chooses to put the subtitle in a separate heading element, like so:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>main</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

Visually, the role of the subtitle would presumably be indicated by its styling. In a non-visual context, this would not be apparent: Traversing from the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> would have a screen reader believe that they had begun reading the article body. By providing the prefix &#8220;Subtitle:&#8221; we clarify the role of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element non-visually, in much the same way as the implicit role of a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element makes screen readers announce &#8220;Button.&#8221;</p><p>The <code>.visually-hidden</code> class invokes a special set of properties, carefully devised to hide the element visually without it becoming silenced in screen reader software. Using <code>display: none;</code>, <code>visibility: hidden;</code>, <code>height: 0;</code> or <code>width: 0;</code> wouldn&#8217;t work &mdash; it would make the span unavailable both visually <em>and</em> aurally.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.visually-hidden </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

Theoretically, the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> <em>should</em> start a new subsection by deferring to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/"><span class="link">HTML5 outline algorithm</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_6"><span class="sup_link">6</span></a></sup>. It would be poorly placed here because we haven&#8217;t even begun the main content of the document (which is the outermost section). But, since the outline algorithm is <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/10/html5-document-outline/"><span class="link">not actually implemented in any user agents</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_7"><span class="sup_link">7</span></a></sup>, this has no effect on assistive technology users. No harm done. Unlike the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is not a landmark, so few screen readers provide it as a navigational tool. Since it&#8217;s the singular child of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, it would take the user to the same place anyway.</p><p>Altogether, deploying <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> doesn&#8217;t look very appealing, but there is a <em>small</em> advantage in certain contexts. The JAWS screen reader (and <em>only</em> the JAWS screen reader) announces &#8220;Article&#8221; on entering the element and &#8220;Article end&#8221; on exiting it. Arguably, this is useful information where there are several <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s on the same page and the user is reading from top to bottom, element by element.

Sometimes they may be the technically correct element to use, but they&#8217;re not supported in any way so have no impact on anyone. Other times they <em>do</em> have an impact but the part they play is confusing, inconsistent or obstructive.</p><p>In her talk &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUkMCQR4TpY"><span class="link">Burn Your Select Tags</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_8"><span class="sup_link">8</span></a></sup>&#8221; (video), Alice Bartlett shares the research she undertook at the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/"><span class="link">UK Government Digital Service</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_9"><span class="sup_link">9</span></a></sup> into <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element usability. Universally implemented and semantic though it is, there&#8217;s compelling evidence that you should avoid using the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element wherever possible. Not only are there discrete technical shortcomings (such as certain devices suppressing the zoom of <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> overlays), but they just don&#8217;t seem to be <em>understood</em> by all sorts of people.</p><h2>Progressive Enhancement And Interoperability</h2><p>The sound semantic structure we&#8217;ve been fostering in our blog article doesn&#8217;t just benefit screen reader users. If a browser fails to load your style sheet, it will still differentiate key elements of the interface using its own default user agent style sheet. Headings, for instance, will appear in bold text and have font sizes indicative of the section depth they represent.</p><p>In addition, services that syndicate your content, such as feed readers, will be able to apply their own structural styles, enabling a comfortable reading experience within their own applications. Content that works well in different contexts and via different inputs can be said to be <em>interoperable</em>. Good semantic structure works well with screen readers, feed readers, search engines and all sorts of other parsers looking for structural meaning in your content.</p><p>A good way to test that your content has a sound structure is to turn CSS off and see if the page is still readable. Are the order and hierarchy apparent? Is the page still navigable and usable?</p><h3>A Note on Single-Page Applications</h3><p>Single-page applications are typified by their use of client-side JavaScript to render and rerender content. Where content is subject to a lot of change as a result of user interaction, this approach enables an immediacy not possible when making round-trips to the server.</p><p>However, when the content you are serving is static and intended for reading alone, relying on client-side JavaScript to render that content is an underperforming and relatively unreliable method. Content should be available to users who do not have JavaScript running or for whom JavaScript has thrown an error, been blocked or failed to load.</p><p>Providing server-rendered content also means that content will be found by folks using search engines, and is parsable by third parties using command line tools like <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html"><span class="link">cURL</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_10"><span class="sup_link">10</span></a></sup>.

Now that we&#8217;re putting a few paragraphs together within a blog article, it&#8217;s probably a good time to review the readability of your content. There are two tests you can perform on your content which assess word, sentence and paragraph length to determine the readability of your text.</p><p>The <em>Flesch reading ease</em> test gives you a score between 0 and 100 where a higher score means more easily readable and, therefore, more inclusive of different readers. The <em>Flesch-Kincaid grade level</em> test is similar but produces a US school grade level. The idea is that the younger the audience who can successfully read it, the more readable it is. Here&#8217;s a summary from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests"><span class="link">the tests&#8217; Wikipedia page</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_14"><span class="sup_link">14</span></a></sup>:</p><table> <tbody><tr> <th>Score</th> <th>School Level</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> <tr> <td>90&ndash;100</td> <td>5th grade</td> <td>Very easy to read.

Conversational English for consumers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>70&ndash;80</td> <td>7th grade</td> <td>Fairly easy to read.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>60&ndash;70</td> <td>8th &amp; 9th grade</td> <td>Plain English.

Amid a maintenance-centric quality assurance culture largely designed by developers <em>for</em> developers, this is most welcome. If poor code style like inconsistent indentation breaks a build, that&#8217;s one thing; but if a build breaks because the product is in danger of alienating a user? All the better. I see no reason why poor readability should not also be considered a point of failure.</p><p>Note, however, that readability is rather subjective. Scientific though a formula for determining readability may sound, you cannot rely on Flesch-Kinkaid tests alone. Use them as an early warning system to highlight potential issues, and test with real users as well.</p><h2>Heading And Link Text</h2><p>If you work as a front-end engineer, you are no doubt familiar with the virtues of modular design. By creating reusable modules (or components), you can develop more rapidly, with tried-and-tested code, and eliminate redundancy. A good module has an independent purpose that can be lent seamlessly to a number of different contexts.</p><p>For the purposes of inclusive design, sometimes our text has to have a certain autonomy as well. Take the following <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading as an example:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Free, you say? Then yes, please!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>In the context of surrounding paragraph text, it is no doubt possible to infer what the heading is referring to. That is, reading from the previous section into this one, you&#8217;d have a good idea of what is free. But this isn&#8217;t much help in a table of contents, listing headings outside of body text. <em>What&#8217;s</em> free?</p><p>Direct, descriptive headings clarify the ensuing content, which aids comprehension across the board. In other words, being cryptic or whimsical doesn&#8217;t get you very far! There&#8217;s also a specific implication for screen reader users: screen readers tend to catalog headings dynamically and offer them as a list to choose from. For instance, in NVDA, I can open the <em>Elements List</em> dialog with <em>Insert</em> + <em>F7</em> and browse a list of headings on the page. Running VoiceOver you can open the <em>rotor</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Option</em> + <em>U</em> on Mac OS X) and see headings listed in a similar fashion.</p><p>Accordingly, the following heading content would be of greater utility (at least if this section of the blog article is indeed about flapjacks, otherwise it would be rather misleading!).</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Free flapjacks, you say? Yes, please!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3>Obnoxious Link Labels</h3><p>Links, like headings, are made available as a list in NVDA&#8217;s elements dialog, and other screen readers aggregate them in a similar fashion. Like headings, link text should be autonomously meaningful. You may have encountered the habit of bloggers using runs of inline links like so:</p><blockquote><p>I have <span class="pseudo-link">a</span> <span class="pseudo-link">lot</span> <span class="pseudo-link">of</span> support to back up my amazing ideas!</p></blockquote><p>Cute, but each link has an entirely meaningless label when taken out of context, not to mention that even read sequentially &#8220;a link lot link of link&#8221; doesn&#8217;t tell us anything useful. In addition, it&#8217;s not always clear visually that there are separate links present. That depends on you identifying breaks in the underline. It&#8217;s even worse if you haven&#8217;t actually <em>provided</em> a link underline.</p><p>If you&#8217;re going to cite the work of other authors, the polite thing to do is mention their works by name. The links in the following example all indicate where they actually take you, and the commas &mdash; plus the &#8220;and&#8221; &mdash; help to separate them.</p><blockquote class="blockquote-regular"><p><em>I have a lot of support to back up my amazing ideas, including</em> <span class="pseudo-link">Why Heydon Is Right <em>by John Thoughtleader</em></span><em>,</em> <span class="pseudo-link">In Support Of Heydon <em>by Jane Unicornfield</em></span><em>, and</em> <span class="pseudo-link">When Heydon Talks It&#8217;s Like He Vomits Fragrant Rainbows <em>by Harry Surname</em></span><em>.</em></p></blockquote><h2>Video</h2><p>As a writer, it is the differentiation and clarification of runs and blocks of words that still excites me most about HTML, old news though this basic feature is. But I appreciate that not everyone is a confident writer or an avid reader. The addition of images, sound and video to blog posts gives color and variety to content, as well as providing more options to those with different abilities and preferences, or in different circumstances.</p><p>Take video. Sometimes it&#8217;s just better to be <em>shown</em> rather than told about how something works. It&#8217;s simply a better way of learning certain things. Other times I might want to be told but <em>not</em> shown, because I need to be looking at something different at the same time. For example, while I&#8217;m working on a visual design for something, I might want to simultaneously listen to the dialog from a conference talk video. On a bus, and without a set of headphones handy, I might want to be shown <em>and</em> told, but without blaring audio at my fellow passengers. Furthermore, watching speakers in the video with captions also available can assist me as a non-native speaker. A well-captioned video is just the ticket.</p><p>Of course, having captions also caters for those who are deaf and hard of hearing, but not <em>just</em> them. It&#8217;s better to see captions as simply &#8220;another way to consume the same content.&#8221; Then you get a better idea of just how many people can make use of them. But captions are only available if the video itself can be downloaded or streamed. This is why video that contains dialog should always be accompanied by a transcript.</p><p>A video blog post should feature the video prominently, but provide a transcript of the video underneath it. Here are a few pointers on posting videos.</p><h3>The Player</h3><p>Make sure the video player is keyboard and screen reader accessible. The fastest way to know if a player is worthy of your use is to try tabbing into it with your keyboard. If you find focus bypasses the player altogether, then game over. Retreat. Find another player.</p><p>Second prize for Worst Keyboard Accessibility Implementation goes to players which you can tab into and use, but without any visual feedback. Remember the &#8220;Indicating Focus&#8221; section in the last chapter? In short: no focus styles, no good. That said, if the various player controls are implemented in HTML and CSS and you can provide your <em>own</em> focus styles, the player may be salvageable. That is, if it&#8217;s screen reader accessible too.</p><p>To get up and running with screen reader testing, I recommend you do the following:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Install the <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/"><span class="link">free NVDA screen reader</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_18"><span class="sup_link">18</span></a></sup> for Windows.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Run it with Firefox exclusively (for maximum compatibility).</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Watch <a href="http://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-testing-nvda-screenreader/"><span class="link">this excellent video introduction from Deque Systems</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_19"><span class="sup_link">19</span></a></sup>.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Refer to <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/nvda"><span class="link">this list of NVDA keyboard commands</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_20"><span class="sup_link">20</span></a></sup> from WebAIM.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Remember that your experience as a screen reader user will differ dramatically from blind users, who have dramatically different strategies even among themselves.

Make sure you use VoiceOver with Safari for the most reliable experience.</p><p>Fortunately, testing an interactive widget like a video player doesn&#8217;t require a working knowledge of the vast array of keyboard commands offered in NVDA and other readers. Just tab to the controls as you would when testing keyboard support and listen for aural feedback. For instance, the play button should say &#8220;Play button&#8221; (or similar) when focused, or &#8220;Pause button&#8221; if the video is already playing. Of course, you should make sure the button can indeed be switched from a <em>press-to-play</em> to a <em>press-to-pause</em> state. This should work by pressing either the <em>Space</em> or <em>Enter</em> keys whether or not a screen reader is running.</p><h4>Recommended Players</h4><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>YouTube&#8217;s embeddable player</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span><a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/"><span class="link">Able Player</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_22"><span class="sup_link">22</span></a></sup></p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span><a href="https://github.com/paypal/accessible-html5-video-player"><span class="link">Accessible HTML5 Video Player</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_23"><span class="sup_link">23</span></a></sup> (from PayPal)</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span><a href="https://ind.ie/blog/accessible-video-player/"><span class="link">Accessible and Responsive HTML5 Video Player</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_24"><span class="sup_link">24</span></a></sup> (by Laura Kalbag)</p><h3>Closed Captions</h3><p>Closed captions are captions which exist in a separate, associated file and can be switched on or off by the user, rather than being embedded into the video itself.

They&#8217;re sitting at a table in a pub. Simon begins the conversation by claiming that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pholcidae"><span class="link">daddy long-legs spider</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_28"><span class="sup_link">28</span></a></sup> has the world&#8217;s most poisonous venom and continues to describe how the spider is, nevertheless, harmless because its teeth are not strong enough to pierce human skin.</p><p>He means <em>fangs</em>, of course. Imagine a spider with teeth!</p><p>In the following illustration, I&#8217;ve chosen to identify the speaker with their name written in capital letters. This is not the <em>only</em> way to identify speakers, but whatever convention you use, make sure it is consistent. Note that the name is not needed for the second caption as the speaker has not changed.</p><p><img src="images/captions1.png" alt="Two frames. In the first frame the left speaker is identified in the caption using an all-caps name followed by a colon." /></p><p>Rupert is aware that this factoid is just an internet rumor and interjects to correct Simon on his <a href="http://www.livescience.com/33625-daddy-longlegs-spiders-poisonous.html"><span class="link">false claim</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_29"><span class="sup_link">29</span></a></sup>.

In the second, the right speaker interjects and is identified by his all-caps name." /></p><p>Before Rupert can finish his sentence, the two speakers are interrupted by a loud crash as the barman drops a glass (out of frame). Often, the description of such a noise is both in caps and bookended by <em>[</em> and <em>]</em> (square brackets). The barman immediately apologizes. I identify that he is out of frame by prefixing a greater-than symbol.</p><p><img src="images/captions3.png" alt="Two frames. In the first, the two speakers are wincing.

Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to write the transcript first, then turn the transcript into captions. In any case, it should take the form of a linearized version of the captions. The only substitution I have made, for clarity where there is no visual context, is that the barman is identified as being out of shot:</p><blockquote><p>SIMON: &#8220;Did you know the daddy long-legs spider is the most poisonous creature in the world? The thing is, though, they can&#8217;t bite you because their teeth are too weak.&#8221;</p><p>RUPERT: &#8220;Well, actually&mdash;&#8221;</p><p>[GLASS BREAKING]</p><p>BARMAN (out of shot): &#8220;Sorry about that!&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>Establishing A Flow System</h2><p>Inclusive web design isn&#8217;t just about providing robust, accessible experiences for users. It&#8217;s also about facilitating and easing the <em>contribution</em> of content by site owners and editors.</p><p>Like a grid system, a <em>flow system</em> uses CSS to manage layout. Unlike a grid system, a flow system deals with the relations between flow elements which appear one after another in a single column &mdash; headings, paragraphs, lists, images, videos, and so on. A good flow system produces a regular, well-spaced, readable procession of elements regardless of their order and combination. This gives editors the freedom to just go ahead and write.</p><h3>Everything Divisible by <code>line-height</code></h3><p>Though a strict <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/chris-peak/2012/12/30/vertical-rhythm.html"><span class="link">vertical rhythm</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_31"><span class="sup_link">31</span></a></sup> is notoriously tough to establish and maintain, it&#8217;s good practice to at least use your paragraph line height as a basis for vertical spacing. So, if paragraphs have a <code>line-height</code> of <code>1.5</code>, one unit of vertical whitespace should be <code>1.5em</code>.</p><p>To enforce a regularity independent of the flow elements incorporated in the editor&#8217;s WYSIWYG or Markdown editor, this basic spacing should be applied generally, with just a few exceptions.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">main * + * </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">margin-top</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token selector">li, dt, dd, br, th, td </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">margin-top</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 0<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Note the use of the <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls"><span class="link">owl selector</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_32"><span class="sup_link">32</span></a></sup></em> in the first line. This ensures that top margins only occur <em>between</em> successive elements. If instead we applied margin directly to elements, there would be the danger of it doubling up with the padding of containers:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.container </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">padding</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token selector">.container p </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">margin-top</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token comment">/* visible space inside top of .container would now be 3em */</span></code></pre><h3>Grouping and Separation</h3><p>Currently, every flow element is separated by the same 1.5em margin, with a few exceptions. List items (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s) do not take margin at all and consequently look grouped together. So they should: for the sake of comprehension on the part of the reader, related elements should be visually proximate.</p><p>By changing the unit of measurement from rem to em, we can achieve a similar effect for subsections of content within our blog: a margin set in em on a heading will be relative to its own font size. Since heading text is larger than body text, this means the heading will appear closer to the content introduced below it.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">* + h2,
* + h3 </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token comment">/* em, not rem, now */</span>
    <span class="token property">margin-top</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5em<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>To separate supplementary content such as blockquotes and illustrations from the paragraph text, you can apply a greater margin for anything that isn&#8217;t a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">main * + *:not(p) </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">margin</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 3rem 0<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>To maintain vertical rhythm, a multiple of our paragraph line height is used (1.5 × 2 = 3). Note that the standard 1.5rem top margin of the element following will be superseded, resulting in a 3rem margin as prescribed both above and below the element in question. This is thanks to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing"><span class="link">collapsing margin behavior</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_33"><span class="sup_link">33</span></a></sup>. The editor can insert a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> or any other element and the spacing will still communicate a break from the prose.</p><p><img src="images/flow.png" alt="Boxes of content. Successive paragraphs have less margin between them than paragraphs and other elements." /><br /><em>In CSS, there&#8217;s little more inclusive than the universal (star) selector. It can help us manage content and its interrelationships inclusively.</em></p><h3>A Note on Defensive Coding</h3><p>I&#8217;ve always found the term WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) a bit misleading, since WYSIWYG editors almost invariably have a habit of leaving lots of undesired, invisible junk in the source.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
<span class="token comment">&lt;!-- ad infinitum --&gt;</span></code></pre><p>In some circumstances this can have an impact on the spacing and vertical rhythm of the rendered content. We can employ some defensive coding here to remove empty elements from the flow. The <code>display:none;</code> declaration eliminates the element&#8217;s layout, including any margins attributed to it.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">main :empty </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>In general, it&#8217;s best to encourage the creation of semantic, well-structured content with a syntax like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"><span class="link">Markdown</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_34"><span class="sup_link">34</span></a></sup> or <a href="http://txstyle.org/"><span class="link">Textile</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_35"><span class="sup_link">35</span></a></sup>. They offer a simple syntax which corresponds to semantic HTML elements such as headings and list items. Where needed, most editors (like the <a href="https://www.penflip.com/"><span class="link">Penflip</span></a><sup><a href="#fn13_36"><span class="sup_link">36</span></a></sup> editor used to write this book) also allow raw HTML input, meaning editors versed in HTML have the option to add more complex content.</p><p>In lieu of training editorial staff to make the switch to structured content and to patch legacy WYSIWYG-based systems, a defensive strategy can help reduce headaches. Time spent fixing layout bugs when entering content is wasted time and contributes to a frustrating and alienating editorial experience.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In the conception of our blog post pattern, I covered one of the most fundamental aspects of inclusive design: <em>structure</em>. By incorporating accessible landmarks and a sound section structure, the content &mdash; blog post or otherwise &mdash; becomes more navigable and interoperable by a diversity of users and parsers. This is bolstered by giving well-written and context-independent structural and navigational cues. We then moved on to supplementing this robust structure with additional media such as video.</p><p>Not just one structure but an infinite number of legitimate configurations of body text, headings and media elements were catered for in our robust and inclusive CSS flow system. This ensured that editors would be able to write freely without having to worry about breaking the visual design.</p><h3>Things to Avoid</h3><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>A lack of
