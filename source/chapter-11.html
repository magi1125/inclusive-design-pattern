In Brad Frost&#8217;s <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms"><span class="link">atomic design terminology</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup>, a paragraph would be an <em>atom</em>: an indivisible building block with which complex patterns (<em>molecules</em>, <em>organisms</em> and <em>pages</em>) are created.</p><p>Some say [a picture paints a thousand words], but I prefer the contrary expression: "&#8220;Never send a picture to do the job of words.&#8221; Text is the most direct and efficient way of communicating information and &mdash; though imagery and other media have supplemental value for those who learn better visually or have literacy issues &mdash; it should be treated as <em>primary</em>. This applies whether you&#8217;re in the business of publishing lengthy, florid prose or dotting isolated descriptions and messages around an application.</p><p>With so many exciting opportunities available to us to build interactive mechanisms, it&#8217;s tempting to neglect the design of our body text. Yet not only is a readable web page an inclusive one, there&#8217;s also some interactivity to address in the forms of zoom functionality and inline hyperlinks.</p><h2>The Typeface</h2><p>There is a lot of conflicting advice on what the characteristics of a readable body text typeface should be. One well-supported claim is that sans serif fonts are more readable than serif ones. Nonetheless, it is entirely possible to design an excruciatingly unreadable font which is technically sans serif.</p><p>Instead of relying on conventional wisdom, here are a few things to ask about a typeface under consideration:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Does it have any ornamentation that gets in the way of comprehension?</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Are the metrics (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height"><span class="link">x-height</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_2"><span class="sup_link">2</span></a></sup>) consistent between letterforms?</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Are individual letterforms distinct in shape or can they be confused with others?</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Does the typeface support all of the characters and font styles that are needed?</p><p><a href="http://bdatech.org/what-technology/typefaces-for-dyslexia/"><span class="link">The British Dyslexia Association notes some specific characteristics</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_3"><span class="sup_link">3</span></a></sup> that can aid legibility. Generous ascenders (e.g. the vertical line in <em>d</em>) and descenders (e.g. the down-pointing line in <em>y</em>) proved popular among dyslexic readers in their research. A <em>d</em> and <em>b</em> which were <em>not</em> an exact mirror image of one another also helped, as well as a clear distinction between an uppercase <em>I</em>, lowercase <em>l</em> and <em>1</em>. Kerning (the spacing between characters) benefited from being reasonably generous, particularly between <em>r</em> and <em>n</em>. Otherwise &#8220;modern&#8221; could be read as &#8220;modem.&#8221;</p><p><img src="images/paragraph_db.png" alt="The characters d and b in two sets. In the first set they are not a mirror image." /><br /><em>Although sans serif fonts are generally thought to be more readable, their simplicity makes them more vulnerable to having similar letterforms.</em></p><p>As with all things, successful comprehension is a question of offering enough but not too much information. Accordingly, serif typefaces are generally regarded as overcomplex, but a purposeful use of serifs to differentiate characters is actually beneficial.</p><p>It&#8217;s important to note that <em>legible</em> body text for folks with reading disorders such as dyslexia is also <em>pleasant</em> body text for those who have less trouble reading. By choosing a typeface that we feel the average user could read, we&#8217;d be consciously alienating a section of our users. Instead, by selecting a typeface which is workable for those who <em>struggle to read</em>, we arrive at a choice that works for everyone. This is efficient and effective inclusive design.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The average user is created from the combination of all users. What we get is, in fact, a completely different user. None of our users is like the average user. Therefore, when designing for that artificial individual we create something that doesn’t fit anyone’s needs.&#8221; &ndash; &#8220;<a href="http://sugoru.com/2013/07/14/designing-for-the-extremes/"><span class="link">Designing for the extremes</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_4"><span class="sup_link">4</span></a></sup>,&#8221; Susana Gonzalez Ruiz</p></blockquote><p>As the excellent article &#8220;<a href="http://sugoru.com/2013/07/14/designing-for-the-extremes/"><span class="link">Designing for the extremes</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_5"><span class="sup_link">5</span></a></sup>&#8221; points out, designing first for users in extreme situations helps us better serve everyone. The article uses bandwidth as another exemplar: a web app that&#8217;s performant on the most unreliable mobile network is, therefore, performant everywhere.</p><p><img src="images/extremes_venns.png" alt="Two Venn diagrams. The first shows that people on poor networks are a subgroup of people who benefit from performant websites. The second shows that people with visual dyslexia are a subgroup of people who benefit from readable fonts." /></p><p>However, it&#8217;s important not to think about extreme cases in isolation and to target specific groups. In <a href="http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/sites/default/files/good_fonts_for_dyslexia_study.pdf"><span class="link">an experimental study carried out in Spain</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_6"><span class="sup_link">6</span></a></sup> (PDF) which investigated the readability of different fonts to dyslexic people, a typeface designed <em>specifically for</em> dyslexic readers performed very poorly. It would appear that the typeface designers, though well-meaning, made some generalizations about the target audience. As a result, they alienated the majority of dyslexic readers as well as creating a &#8220;clunky and difficult to read&#8221; font for everyone. In the article &#8220;<a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3038596/fast-feed/a-typeface-for-dyslexics-dont-buy-into-the-hype"><span class="link">A Typeface For Dyslexics? Don&#8217;t Buy Into The Hype</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_7"><span class="sup_link">7</span></a></sup>,&#8221; the creator of the Lucida typeface, Chuck Bigelow, corroborates these findings with his own research.</p><h2>Typesetting</h2><p>Having chosen an inclusive typeface, we ought to do it justice with good composition. Inclusive typesetting aids readability and is the task of choosing a measure, justification and leading which suit the typeface at hand. These provisions, according to Bigelow and others, are likely more important than the choice of font (unless the font is eye-wateringly illegible, of course).</p><h3>Measure</h3><p>A paragraph&#8217;s measure is the length, in characters, of one line. In text that isn&#8217;t justified (see &#8220;Justification&#8221; below) this will vary, so you should measure the longest line of a sample paragraph. Lines that are too long are difficult to read because, on reaching the end of the line, scanning back to find the start of the following line becomes problematic. Lines that are too short require darting your eyes back and forth too frequently &mdash; something that becomes tiresome quickly.</p><p>In Robert Bringhurst&#8217;s book <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>, he recommends a measure between 45 and 75 characters. In CSS, 1rem roughly corresponds to the width of the typeface&#8217;s lowercase <em>m</em>, so a paragraph which is 60rem wide could be said to have a measure of 60 &mdash; nicely within range for comfort.</p><p>Setting paragraphs&#8217; measure directly is unwise, since in responsive and modular layouts they should wrap according to their containing element. Bearing this in mind, no container of text in your layout should exceed your stated measure. For instance, your <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element should be set with an appropriate <code>max-width</code>.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">main </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">max-width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 60rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>This has a useful outcome regarding media queries which augment the root font size: the measure adjusts proportionately. For example, where I increase the font size for wider desktop screens, the measure &mdash; which is defined using a unit relative to the font size (rem) &mdash; also increases.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">html </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100%<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token selector">main </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">max-width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 60rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token atrule">@media (min-width: 120rem) </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token selector">html </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 150%<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>By virtue of relativity, we don&#8217;t just set an inclusive measure but <em>ensure it</em> within responsive layouts too.</p><h3>Justification</h3><p>Justification, possible by setting <code>text-align: justify;</code> in your CSS, is generally considered bad practice for web content. Justification means making each line the same length, which makes paragraphs look neater but can severely impair readability. If you&#8217;ll excuse the pun, I&#8217;ve struggled to justify using justified text on many occasions because I just like the way it looks. I&#8217;d be the first to admit I was putting vanity before inclusion. Bad dog!</p><p>In text justification, to make each line of equal length, words need to be redistributed within their lines, creating distractingly uneven word spacing.</p><p><img src="images/justification.png" alt="Three columns of justified text with two instances of large word spaces highlighted." /><br /><em>Justified text produces the worst results when using a narrow measure, such as in the column-based layout illustrated.</em></p><p>In desktop publishing, this issue is mitigated by hyphenation: breaking up larger words to redistribute them more evenly. Unfortunately, CSS hyphenation, available via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens"><span class="link"><code>hyphens</code></span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_8"><span class="sup_link">8</span></a></sup> property, is poorly implemented across browsers. One of the most popular browsers, Chrome, does not support hyphenation at all. To make matters worse, <a href="https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator"><span class="link">JavaScript polyfills</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_9"><span class="sup_link">9</span></a></sup> for hyphenation tend to be extremely weighty because they must refer to a large library of agreed hyphenation patterns. Not all browsers even support hyphenation for languages other than English.</p><p>For good readability without JavaScript dependencies and their attendant performance issues, the default <code>text-align</code> value of <code>left</code> is preferable. This results in a ragged right-hand side to your paragraphs, but users won&#8217;t care. They&#8217;ll be too busy effortlessly digesting your content.</p><h3>Leading (<code>line-height</code>)</h3><p>Leading relates to the height of individual lines. It is the vertical measure between one line&#8217;s baseline and the next. In the W3C&#8217;s WCAG 2.0 accessibility guideline <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation"><span class="link">1.4.8 Visual Presentation</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_10"><span class="sup_link">10</span></a></sup>, it is recommended that a generous &#8220;space-and-a-half&#8221; of leading is applied to paragraphs. In CSS this can be expressed using the <code>line-height</code> property. For instance, if the font size was 16px, the leading should be <em>at least</em> 24px. However, as stated earlier in &#8220;The Document,&#8221; it&#8217;s rarely advisable to use fixed units like pixels because it makes managing comfortable proportions a headache. Instead, <code>line-height</code> should be set as a unitless proportion:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token comment">/* (life is too short)
p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 24px;
}
*/</span>

<span class="token selector">p </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1rem<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">line-height</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1.5<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Now, as the paragraph font size is increased or decreased (either in a media query or by the user changing their font size settings), a comfortable, proportionate line height is ensured. When a pixel-based line height is used, the following is the result:</p><p><img src="images/fixed_line-height.png" alt="Two paragraphs. The left one has a comfortable line height. The right one has the same line height but with larger letterforms, forcing each line to overlap." /><br /><em>The danger of a line height that is not relative to the font size.</em></p><h3>Contrast</h3><p>Why so many type designers are enamored with pale gray text on a white background, I&#8217;ll never know. Quite apart from it causing readability issues, it just looks feeble. In any case, low-contrast combinations of text and background colors should be avoided.</p><p>Since it&#8217;s easy to become wedded to brand colors early in a project, instead of testing color contrast after the fact, I recommend designing an accessible color scheme from the outset. Free tools like <a href="http://www.dasplankton.de/ContrastA/"><span class="link">Contrast-A</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_11"><span class="sup_link">11</span></a></sup> (requires Flash) and <a href="http://colorsafe.co/"><span class="link">Color Safe</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_12"><span class="sup_link">12</span></a></sup> are available to help you there. If you end up in the unfortunate position that colors were chosen without recourse to contrast accessibility, tools like <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/"><span class="link">Color Contrast Analyser</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_13"><span class="sup_link">13</span></a></sup> can help you identify problem areas. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s not me who&#8217;ll have to inform your brand guru!</p><p>What&#8217;s less known is that very high contrast can actually <em>diminish</em> readability for some users. Sufferers of <a href="http://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/"><span class="link">scotopic sensitivity syndrome</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_14"><span class="sup_link">14</span></a></sup> (or Irlen syndrome) are sensitive to glare, and stark contrast can result in blurred text or text that appears to move around. It is advisable to slightly temper the contrast between your paragraph text and background color.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">main </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">background</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #eee<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token selector">p </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #222<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>As I&#8217;ll restate throughout the book, there&#8217;s rarely an inclusive design provision that benefits only one kind of user or reader. At this juncture I&#8217;d like to thank you in advance for dampening contrast in this way. That&#8217;s because bright light has a habit of triggering migraines for me. Thank you.</p><h2>Inline Links</h2><p>CSS is a blessing and a curse. It gives us the freedom to exercise our creativity, and it <em>gives us the freedom to exercise our creativity</em>. I&#8217;m not saying every website and app should look the same, but we have a habit of breaking with conventions just to appear radical. Here&#8217;s the thing: in a world of artifice and ornamentation, <em>utility</em> is radical. And utility depends on cognition, which depends on convention. The trick is to embrace convention without dispensing with personality.</p><p>Save for button-like call-to-action links which play by different rules of affordance, it is conventional for links to be underlined. Not only does capitalizing on this convention help folks to identify links within paragraph text, but it also alleviates a more extreme concern of inclusive design: color blindness. By differentiating inline links by color alone, some readers will not be able to pick them out from the surrounding text, so there should be another means.</p><p>For this reason, all browsers render text with <code>text-decoration: underline</code> by default, making inline link design a classic case of doing <em>nothing</em> being a perfectly good resolution. But it&#8217;s possible to improve on <code>text-decoration: underline</code>. With custom CSS, we can keep the symbolic role of an underline but implement it better.</p><h3>Improved Link Underlines</h3><p>Since an underline tends to sit directly below the typeface&#8217;s baseline, it cuts through the descenders of letterforms like <em>g</em> and <em>j</em>, diminishing the readability of linked text. Ideally, the underline should not intersect the form of descenders but leave space for them. A <a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9#.hnbr08cjr"><span class="link">solution partly developed at Medium</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_15"><span class="sup_link">15</span></a></sup> does just this, using a CSS background gradient and text shadow. Here is my adapted version:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">p a </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">text-decoration</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

        0.1em 0 0 #fff, -0.1em 0 0 #fff,
        0 0.1em 0 #fff, 0 -0.1em 0 #fff<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token property">background-position</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> bottom 0.05em center<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 100% 0.05em<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p><img src="images/improved_underline.png" alt="The standard text decoration underline compared with the superior gradient technique. The gradient version pairs blue text with a gray underline." /><br /><em>When using custom, gradient-based underlines you have the luxury of being able to control their color independently of the font color.</em></p><p>In this implementation, a <code>linear-gradient</code> background with a height of just 0.05em forms the underline. Descenders are not crossed thanks to a text shadow which protects the letterforms like a moat protects a castle.</p><p>Note that unlike <code>text-decoration: underline;</code>, this underline is adjustable. You can tweak the vertical positioning using <code>background-position</code>, and the thickness using <code>background-size</code> to find the most readable solution for the typeface. Be wary, though, of older browsers that do not support gradient backgrounds. These should have a <code>text-decoration</code> fallback:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.ie-lte-9 a </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">text-decoration</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> underline<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><h3>Indicating Focus</h3><p>One approach to inclusive interaction design is to look at interfaces from the perspective of human interface devices (HIDs): different devices which allow input from and/or output to a human user. A mouse is an HID. So are keyboards, touch displays, refreshable braille displays and keyboards, <a href="http://www.bltt.org/hardware/joysticks.htm"><span class="link">joysticks</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_16"><span class="sup_link">16</span></a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access"><span class="link">switches</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_17"><span class="sup_link">17</span></a></sup>. Designing inclusively is to support as many of these as possible and provide alternative content and interaction mechanisms where this isn&#8217;t possible.</p><p>Making an element keyboard-accessible is quite straightforward:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Make sure the element is focusable.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Make sure the focusable element is visible.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Make sure the focus state of the element is visible.</p><p>Links, like the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element addressed in the introduction, are implicitly focusable. Thanks to standard browser behavior, any <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with an <code>href</code> attribute which is the next focusable element within the document will gain focus when the user hits the <em>Tab</em> key. It then becomes operable: you can follow the link by pressing <em>Enter</em>.</p><p>Even so, if links are not styled so their focus state is indicated, it&#8217;s impossible for the user to see which element is indeed in current focus. This is where <em>focus styles</em> come in. Browsers implement their own focus styles ranging from dotted outlines to fuzzy blue halos. You can replace these default styles, but you should <em>never</em> just remove them. We can strengthen and simultaneously normalize the appearance of focus styles for our paragraph links across browsers by using a <code>background-color</code> solution.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">p a:focus </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">outline</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #cef<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p><img src="images/focus_styles.png" alt="The basic dotted outline focus style compared with a blue background focus style." /><br /><em>A background color creates a filled box which is easier to identify as focus moves between elements than the dotted outline some browsers provide by default.</em></p><p>This is much clearer than the thin dotted outline that many browsers apply by default. It&#8217;s a style implemented on the official UK government website, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/"><span class="link">GOV.UK</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_18"><span class="sup_link">18</span></a></sup>; an exemplar of inclusive service design, with a responsibility to be usable by every British citizen.</p><p>The subject of focus styles will come up in many patterns to follow, as more and different interactive elements are added to our vocabulary.</p><h2>Automated Icons</h2><p>Folks who update and maintain websites can be non-technical and frequently have no confidence (nor interest) in visual design. An inclusive editorial system should be streamlined so that it doesn&#8217;t force editors to think about and deal in code or formatting. It should enable them to get on with what they&#8217;re good at without the fear of breaking anything.</p><p>By employing a modicum of fairly advanced CSS, it&#8217;s possible to provide iconography within paragraph text which is inclusive on two counts:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>It does not complicate the editorial process.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>It provides accessible information to users.</p><p>When linking to an external resource on a separate domain, it&#8217;s polite to inform the user that following the link will take them out of the current context. This is especially helpful to screen reader users who will have become accustomed to the current site&#8217;s features and layout. In other words, you avoid a &#8220;Where the hell am I?&#8221; moment.</p><h3>Identifying External Links</h3><p>The first step is to identify which links qualify as external. Any link <code>href</code> which begins with <em>http</em> (i.e. is not a relative link) <em>and</em> does not link to the current domain passes muster. My blog&#8217;s local domain is <em>heydonworks.com</em>, so I&#8217;d build a selector like this:</p><pre><code class=" language-css">[href^=<span class="token string">"http"</span>]<span class="token punctuation">:</span>not([href*=<span class="token string">"heydonworks.com"</span>])</code></pre><p>Translated, the selector reads, &#8220;Links with <code>href</code> values that start with <em>http</em> but do not contain the string <em>heydonworks.com</em>.&#8221;</p><h3>Providing the Icon</h3><p>As discussed, an inclusive editorial experience is one where the editor is not asked to think and work in an unfamiliar way. In which case, we don&#8217;t want to ask editors to have to upload and link icon images or &mdash; worse still &mdash; edit the source to add a <code>class</code> attribute to each external link. Instead, we can use CSS pseudo-content to automatically add the icon based on the matched selector:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">[href^="http"]:not([href*="heydonworks.com"])::after </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> inline-block<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1em<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">height</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1em<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-image</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token url">url('path/to/external-icon.svg')</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-repeat</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> no-repeat<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-position</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> center<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 75% auto<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Note the use of relative units and a percentage-based <code>background-size</code> to make sure the icon scales with the text when it is resized by the user or in a media query.</p><h3>Alternative Text</h3><p>That just leaves adding some hidden text to also inform screen reader users that the link is external. This is achievable using the <code>content</code> property and a few supplementary rules to move it out of sight without affecting layout.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">[href^="http"]:not([href*="heydonworks.com"])::after </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> inline-block<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1em<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Not all screen reader and browser combinations support pseudo-content, but most do. Those that don&#8217;t support it provide a less informative experience, but not a broken one.</p><h2>Writing Paragraphs</h2><p>It would be remiss of me to talk about inclusive paragraph design without mentioning how to actually <em>write</em> approachable, accessible content. Copywriting requires design just as much as form and composition, but in a culture dominated by visual design it tends to be put to one side; deferred until frankly less important decisions about aesthetics and ornamentation have been settled.</p><p>I&#8217;m a big believer in <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/content-first-design"><span class="link">content-first design</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_20"><span class="sup_link">20</span></a></sup>. As stated in the principles outlined in the introduction, all other design activities should be treated as merely supportive of the content and its formation.</p><p>What makes things hard is that, unlike dealing in accessible interaction states or color contrast levels, accessible wording is not easy to measure. Nonetheless, there are some general guidelines that are applicable to paragraph text:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Write short paragraphs, sentences and words. &#8220;I purchased a mammalian companion of the canine variety&#8221; is never better than &#8220;I bought a dog.&#8221;</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Be wary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_passive_voice"><span class="link">passive sentences</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_21"><span class="sup_link">21</span></a></sup>. They can often be replaced by a more direct alternative. There&#8217;s no need to say the convoluted, &#8220;a pork pie was eaten by Harry&#8221; when you can just as well say, &#8220;Harry ate a pork pie.&#8221;</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Eliminate redundancy. It&#8217;s rarely worth saying the same thing twice in different ways. Avoid repetition. (See what I did there?)</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Vary the length of sentences and paragraphs. This reduces monotony, encouraging focus.</p><p>Acknowledging the importance of good copy design will form a part of many patterns in this book. For example, &#8220;The Blog Post&#8221; will cover testing content readability against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests"><span class="link">Flesch-Kincaid scale</span></a><sup><a href="#fn11_22"><span class="sup_link">22</span></a></sup>. For now, note this down: <em>everything but content is an enhancement</em>. Therefore, your prototypes and minimum viable product should contain <em>real</em> and preferably well-considered copy, ready to be tested with your users. If you&#8217;re going to get something right from the outset make it the content, <em>not</em> the typography, layout or color scheme.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Well, there&#8217;s more that goes into humble paragraph text design than perhaps you first imagined. By looking at typefaces, leading, measure, justification, contrast, focus indication and more, we&#8217;ve set ourselves on the right path to formulate paragraphs suited for a hugely diverse audience. By tackling specific issues we know would affect folks with limited vision, dyslexia, Irlen syndrome, low literacy and limited technical knowledge, a comfortable reading and interaction experience has been ensured for most everyone else.</p><h3>Things to Avoid</h3><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Wording and typefaces designed to impress rather than communicate.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>A measure that&#8217;s too long or too short.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Reasonably high contrast, without defaulting to stark black on white.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Eliminating focus styles with <code>outline: none;</code>.</p><div class="fn_overview"><p class="separator">—</p><p id="fn11_1"><span
