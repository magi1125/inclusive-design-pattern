Though you&#8217;re likely to use some as presented (like the <em>navigation region</em> pattern) across many of your projects, they&#8217;re really just examples. They&#8217;re here to help you practice <em>thinking inclusively</em> as you formulate your own patterns to solve your own design problems. It&#8217;s investing this thought in the early stages of the design process that leads to a robust product.</p><p>Drawing on what we learn about our potential audience in the <a href="http://www.uxapprentice.com/discovery/"><span class="link">discovery phase</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup> of our project, we begin to think about what tasks our app will allow users to perform. In essence, we begin to stockpile verbs: create, sort, edit, buy, read, respond, move, capture, draw, upload.</p><p>It&#8217;s imperative we think first about how these actions might be taken rather than how the experience might look and feel. Thinking about aesthetics and delight is far too high-level at this stage. We need to prototype for usability, and the more inclusive the prototyping experience, the more people will find the product usable.</p><h2>Paper Prototyping</h2><p>Almost all of the successful projects I&#8217;ve worked on as a designer and developer have included interactive paper prototyping in the early stages of the design process. For example, the <a href="https://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/"><span class="link">Great British Public Toilet Map</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_2"><span class="sup_link">2</span></a></sup> started out with me drawing and cutting out pictures of toilets in the offices of <a href="https://www.neontribe.co.uk/"><span class="link">Neontribe</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_3"><span class="sup_link">3</span></a></sup>.</p><p>Not to be confused with sketching, paper prototyping is about creating an <em>interactive</em> prototype from paper, which &mdash; with the help of someone to manually operate it &mdash; allows user testers to play with a rough-and-ready demo version of the candidate app.</p><p>There are a number of advantages to paper prototyping over high fidelity and code-based demos.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span><strong>Most anyone can work with paper.</strong> Coded prototypes require some skill in front-end development. Committing to work with paper means other team members, including back-end developers and others not confident in their design skills, can have a try. Importantly, it also means stakeholders and test users can be included in iteration.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span><strong>It&#8217;s easy to iterate.</strong> Paper prototypes are mostly just pen on paper, held together with sticky tack. By using sticky tack to piece components together, it&#8217;s easy to move parts around. If you want new parts, just get out some spare bits of paper and your marker pens. This can be done during test sessions and can involve everyone present &mdash; infinitely preferable to sitting around twiddling thumbs while a front-end dev fiddles anxiously with their laptop.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span><strong>It&#8217;s not polished.</strong> The trouble with high-fidelity mockups and prototypes is that they tend to look finished. People are polite and you won&#8217;t get honest feedback about something that looks like it&#8217;s had a lot of work put into it. That it&#8217;s made of paper at all means it&#8217;s clearly only an allegory of the real app, so feedback about aesthetic particulars is kept to a minimum. Focus remains on whether the idea solves the problem well.</p><h3>What You Will Need</h3><p>Let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re embarking on a paper prototype. First, we&#8217;ll take care of what you need in terms of equipment and why.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Large pieces of paper (preferably A2)</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Scissors</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Sticky tack</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Permanent marker pens</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Sheets of acetate</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>A dry-wipe (whiteboard-style) pen</p><h4>Large Pieces of Paper</h4><p>Whether your prototype is intended to demo an app for small handheld devices or large installation screens, it&#8217;s better to begin large. A large viewport (paper sheet to which smaller parts of the paper app are adhered) means more people in your test environment can simultaneously see it as it is being used. That means everyone can feel involved, and more and better notes can be taken. Obviously, you&#8217;ll need a table big enough to sit the prototype on!</p><h4>Scissors</h4><p>Just like a real app, the viewport will be divided into smaller sections or components. You&#8217;ll need to cut some of your larger sheets into smaller ones to be placed on top of the base sheet. If you have a guillotine handy all the better, but don&#8217;t worry too much about all the lines being parallel. The wonkier the prototype looks (within reason!), the less intimidating and more approachable it is.</p><h4>Sticky Tack</h4><p>Sticky tack is what makes the paper app modular and lets you quickly move components around, either as part of the app&#8217;s operation or as part of layout iteration. Whenever a part of a component is liable to be moved or replaced, use a separate piece of paper and stick it in place with tack.</p><h4>Permanent Marker Pens</h4><p>Of course, you&#8217;ll need to write labels, draw borders around buttons and make various other markings, so some pens are essential. However, try to limit yourself to just a few colors &mdash; this isn&#8217;t an art project. I usually make sure I have a couple of black pens, then choose a red for errors, green for success messages, and blue for links and buttons.</p><h4>Sheets of Acetate</h4><p>If you&#8217;re making an app, there are probably going to be some input fields. Acetate is great when it comes to prototyping input fields because it allows the user tester to write on the paper prototype non-permanently. They can correct their mistakes and the writing can be quickly removed ready for the next test session.</p><h4>A Dry-Wipe Pen</h4><p>Naturally, you&#8217;ll need one of these for use with the acetate (see above). This is not used in the construction of the prototype, but is needed in the testing described below. Make sure the one you take to the test session has some ink in it!</p><p><img src="images/tacking.png" alt="Left diagram shows sticky tack being adhered to four corners of paper rectangle. Right diagram shows this paper rectangle being stuck to a larger piece of paper." /><br /><em>After adhering sticky tack to each corner of your component (1), you can place it on a larger, parent component (2). You can always unstick it and move it later.</em></p><h3>Testing the Paper Prototype</h3><p>Paper prototype testing is a slightly unusual ritual with a few things to remember and set up.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">1. </span><strong>Bring plenty of spares.</strong> A good session leads to fevered iteration. Lots of spare paper and plenty of pens and scissors to go around are vital.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">2. </span><strong>Write a scenario.</strong> Putting a user tester in front of your prototype cold will amount to stunned inaction. Give them a scenario to work through, something the app should be able to solve for them. It&#8217;s important this scenario is fictional, and not drawn from the individual&#8217;s real experiences for the sake of privacy.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">3. </span><strong>Appoint a <em>computer</em>.</strong> Someone who built the prototype will have to operate it. That means reacting to (role-played) input by the user tester. When the tester presses a button, for instance, the computer will have to reorganize the app in response. If the button deletes something this would mean unsticking the paper component and putting it to one side.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">4. </span><strong>Give clear instructions.</strong> Tell the user tester they can touch any items in the interface they think are interactive. Importantly, tell them to speak out loud what they are thinking as they use the prototype. This is important for understanding where there are usability failures and what needs to be overcome.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="digit">5. </span><strong>Instill calm.</strong> It&#8217;s easy for the user to feel tested, so make it clear that you are not testing them but the app itself. If they don&#8217;t know how to operate it, make it clear in advance that it&#8217;s not their fault, but yours as the designer.</p><p><img src="images/test_usability.png" alt="On left, a smartphone with a heavy weight hung precariously over it. On right, a person with a heavy weight hung precariously over them. The text underneath reads ‘Test usability, not users.’" /><br /><em>A T-shirt design I made for usability expert <a href="http://lilydart.com/"><span class="caption-link">Lily Dart</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_4"><span class="sup_link">4</span></a></sup> during her time consulting my former employer, <a href="https://www.neontribe.co.uk/"><span class="caption-link">Neontribe</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_5"><span class="sup_link">5</span></a></sup>. It bears her mantra, &#8220;Test usability, not users.&#8221;</em></p><h4>The Layout</h4><p>To give you a better picture of the testing setup, here&#8217;s an annotated sketch.</p><p><img src="images/paper_aerial.png" alt="An aerial view of the testing session. Participants sit around a table with the person playing the computer on the left and two user testers to the right. Only one is operating the prototype. A note taker sits at the bottom center." /></p><p class="list"><span class="digit">1. </span>The person playing the computer.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">2. </span>A collection of prototype bits and pieces (other screens, yet-to-be-revealed functionality, etc.).</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">3. </span>The app.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">4. </span>The user tester, operating the prototype.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">5. </span>It&#8217;s often beneficial to have a passive second tester, sat with the user tester for moral support and to encourage dialogue.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="digit">6. </span>A note taker. Notice the neutral seating position between the computer and testers. By sitting here, between the two parties at either end, the testers should feel less scrutinized.</p><h2>From Paper To Code</h2><p>After a few sessions of paper prototype testing, you should have a lot of torn-up paper and a better idea of the app you should be building. The way you translate the surviving bits of paper into coded modules is critical for an inclusive end product. It&#8217;s in the creation of your <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/an-in-depth-overview-of-living-style-guide-tools/"><span class="link">living styleguide</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_6"><span class="sup_link">6</span></a></sup> that you should be drawing on the inclusive coding practices you&#8217;ve been learning in this book.</p><p>In a large team, this can be a collaborative effort with some friendly competition to reach the best solutions. In her article, &#8220;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone"><span class="link">From Pages To Patterns: An Exercise For Everyone</span></a><sup><a href="#fn19_7"><span class="sup_link">7</span></a></sup>,&#8221; Charlotte Jackson recommends that after agreeing on which components are which and what they should be named, you should get straight into coding. Charlotte sets it out simply, like this:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Everyone grab a component.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Code it up in HTML and CSS. Set a time limit and resist the temptation to perfect things. It&#8217;s fine to throw away the code if the designs change.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Compare and discuss your code.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Repeat.</p><p>I would suggest a couple of stipulations to really make the most of this in terms of inclusive design. First, I&#8217;d recommend several individuals (or teams) work on the same component so there are different solutions to compare. Second, accessibility should be a prerequisite for consideration. If a solution isn&#8217;t keyboard-accessible, uses a poor structure or is not explicable by screen reader, it&#8217;s out.</p><p>The quickest way to prototype in code is to use standard HTML elements such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. They give you the behaviors you need to make your component functional. It&#8217;s usually only when we begin overengineering custom components that we encounter issues. By going straight from paper to HTML, we lay the foundations for efficient code and inclusive experiences. It is based on this foundation that we can enrich the experience with CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>After all, you can&#8217;t even <em>have</em> CSS or JavaScript without some HTML on which to stick them. So, you might as well get the HTML right first.</p><div class="fn_overview"><p class="separator">—</p><p id="fn19_1"><span class="fn_number">1.</span><a href="http://www.uxapprentice.com/discovery/"><span class="fn_link">http://www.uxapprentice.com/discovery/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_2"><span class="fn_number">2.</span><a href="https://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/"><span class="fn_link">https://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_3"><span class="fn_number">3.</span><a href="https://www.neontribe.co.uk/"><span class="fn_link">https://www.neontribe.co.uk/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_4"><span class="fn_number">4.</span><a href="http://lilydart.com/"><span class="fn_link">http://lilydart.com/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_5"><span class="fn_number">5.</span><a href="https://www.neontribe.co.uk/"><span class="fn_link">https://www.neontribe.co.uk/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_6"><span class="fn_number">6.</span><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/an-in-depth-overview-of-living-style-guide-tools/"><span class="fn_link">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/an-in-depth-overview-of-living-style-guide-tools/</span></a></p><p id="fn19_7"><span class="fn_number">7.</span><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone"><span class="fn_link">http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone</span></a></p></div></div></body></html>
