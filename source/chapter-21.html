So, one Sikh, and&hellip;&#8221;<br class="nobreak" />&ndash; The Office, Season 4,</em> Fun Run</p></blockquote><p>Business tends to concern itself with targeting and communicating to a receptive audience. The creators of a photography website, for example, would seek to identify and target people who like photography and, well, websites. For most marketers, research doesn&#8217;t stop there. They&#8217;ll look into age groups, related interests, competing websites, income, aspirations and even gender.</p><p>Fortunately for you &mdash; the inclusive designer &mdash; the precarious and error-prone art of marketing is none of your concern because abilities, preferences and circumstances have little to do with interests, tastes or lifestyle choices. And while second guessing who might <em>want</em> to use our products is a game we have to play, making assumptions about <em>how</em> folks use them can only alienate potential fans and customers.</p><p>Targeting a so-called average user is a disastrous interface design strategy, because average users do not exist &mdash; except for the handful of people teetering on the apex of your bell curve. The popular utensil firm OXO knows this well and by catering to extreme situations and disabilities first, they&#8217;ve produced highly ergonomic products with mainstream appeal. In <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/Case-studies-and-examples/3-case-studies-on-UD/#oxo"><span class="link">OXO&#8217;s own words</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;When all users&#8217; needs are taken into consideration in the initial design process, the result is a product that can be used by the broadest spectrum of users.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In the design of the hypothetical photography site, it&#8217;s tempting for the business to try to write off support for users they don&#8217;t think will be interested in it. That way, maybe they can save money. &#8220;Blind users aren&#8217;t likely to be interested in photography, so why bother making the site screen reader accessible?&#8221; they might think.</p><p>Meet Sandra. She was a photographer until the age of thirty-seven, when she lost her sight. Her interest in photography never really diminished, though. She enjoys being an active member of the online photography community where she can trade the technical know-how she&#8217;s picked up over the years for detailed descriptions of photographs.</p><p>There&#8217;s always a Sandra, and she deserves an experience just as good as the Ryans, Barbaras and Xaviers of this world. But also consider the following:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>The features Sandra wants (a social dimension and text descriptions) are not exclusive to her or other blind users for reasons of <em>being</em> blind.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Including these features does not alienate other types of user in favor of people like Sandra.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Making these features accessible to blind and low-vision users has benefits for other types of user. For example, <code>alt</code> text describes images in text-only browsers or where image requests return a 403, 404, 500 or 503 status. Screen reader accessibility also requires keyboard accessibility, which helps folks with a range of rheumatic complaints, as well as conditions that cause inaccuracy with a mouse, such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease or dyspraxia. And that doesn&#8217;t begin to cover all of the folks who use the keyboard when browsing &mdash; clinical condition or no.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody is a keyboard user when eating with their mouse hand.&#8221; &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/388733408576159744"><span class="link">Adrian Roselli</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_2"><span class="sup_link">2</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p>No matter what the content or the commercial offer, there is no reason to second-guess how the user might operate the interface. In fact, doing so can only reduce the quality of the product. To save money, you are going to want to make just the one interface, not a different one for each imagined user group. So, you make it inclusive. You make inclusivity a <em>quality</em> of the product &mdash; not an expensive additional feature.</p><p>When inclusion is integrated into the design process in this way, it&#8217;s very little more work. In fact, using standard technologies in expected ways often means less work. For example, devising an inaccessible, custom-authored <code>&lt;div class="heading-3"&gt;</code> is actually <em>more</em> typing than using a standard <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>. It gets even more verbose when you&#8217;re wedded to using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and have to fix the heading accessibility <em>after the fact</em> with ARIA attributes:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- life is too short! --&gt;</span>

The product list is the set of prints returned after the user has entered a product search term. We need to look at how individual products might be marked up and presented, including illustrations and calls to action &mdash; the aim is to get users to buy things, after all.</p><p>I&#8217;ve expounded the virtues of lists in previous patterns. They itemize their contents accessibly, group content thematically, and break up otherwise structureless, undifferentiated runs of prose. So far, we&#8217;ve only included text and inline elements (links) to make terse list items, but it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to define more complex structures.</p><p>Though the pattern as documented in your pattern library is likely only to define the structure of one product item, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge context and belonging first. Let&#8217;s start a list of products and use the contents of the first list item as the product template.</p><p>Using an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element, let&#8217;s give our product a title.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

Other screen reader users might traverse the list using direct list navigation. For instance, JAWS offers the <code>I</code> (for <em>item</em>) shortcut key to move from one list item to the next.

Suffice to say, unless you&#8217;re selling an intangible product like a six-month subscription or eternal happiness, your users are going to want to get a good look at their potential purchase.</p><p>The product thumbnail is essentially the <em>canonical</em> image of the product.

Similar products (such as red and yellow versions of the same T-shirt design) should be presented the same way, from the same angle, denoting equivalency.</p><p><img src="images/t-shirts.png" alt="Three of the same T-shirt in different colors.

To get an impression of how slow loading a page full of raster thumbnails can be, find an existing site with the kind of content we&#8217;re discussing, then open Chrome&#8217;s developer tools. Next, press the <em>Toggle device toolbar</em> button (<em>Cmd</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>M</em>). Choose <em>Show throttling</em> from the menu and select &#8220;Regular 3G&#8221; &mdash; not the slowest or fastest connection.</p><p>Now reload the page and wait. And then wait some more.</p><p>But boredom isn&#8217;t the only issue. Loading this many images over a mobile network is costly too. To give you an impression, take the URL of the site you were just testing and head over to <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/"><span class="link">What Does My Site Cost</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_12"><span class="sup_link">12</span></a></sup> to find out how many cents it&#8217;ll cost in data to retrieve just that one page, replete with all the images.</p><p>Web developers tend to have expensive data contracts and spend most of their working day connected to lightning-fast broadband. The experience is both a privileged and an unrepresentative one. To be inclusive of those on poor networks, with smaller budgets or being subject to huge roaming charges, we need to mitigate the impact that loading all of these images is likely to have.</p><p>This book is not the place to discuss the ins and outs of handling image assets for performance but, briefly, let&#8217;s consider some important techniques.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">1. </span><strong>Compression:</strong> If you do nothing else, make sure your images are compressed. Compressing images needn&#8217;t be the arduous, manual task it once was, now that we can make use of automation tools like <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac"><span class="link">ImageOptim</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_13"><span class="sup_link">13</span></a></sup>.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">2. </span><strong>Lazy loading:</strong> There&#8217;s no need to load images unless they are to be seen. Using lazy loading means not downloading the image resource unless or until the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> element enters the viewport. There are a number of scripts and plugins available, each working by replacing a dummy <code>src</code> value with a real one contained in a <code>data-</code> attribute. For our product list, each image&#8217;s markup might look like <code>&lt;img src="dummy.jpg" data-src="/images/naked-forecourt-man.jpg" width="400" height="300"&gt;</code>.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="digit">3. </span><strong>The <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element:</strong> This allows you to tailor images to viewports. Since smaller viewports are more likely to be used with mobile devices and networks, you can benefit from prescribing physically smaller &mdash; therefore less weighty and costly &mdash; images. We might, accordingly, incorporate markup similar to that in the following illustration:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>picture</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

Be aware that this is not an exact science. It&#8217;s entirely possible that some of your users will be connected via a slow mobile network on a device featuring a viewport greater than 800px in width.</p><h2>The &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; Action</h2><p>Unless we&#8217;re <em>entirely</em> lacking in business acumen, we&#8217;re going to want to facilitate the user&#8217;s purchase of the print. Including a &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button is perhaps the most straightforward way to go about this. Even so, there are some pitfalls to avoid.</p><h3>Buttons versus <em>Buttons</em></h3><p>The first pitfall regards the concept of buttons and their expected behavior. Despite so-called &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; buttons having the appearance of a button, their behavior links to a resource &mdash; they are hyperlinks.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"/product/naked-man-in-garage"</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"button"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Buy Now<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>In a noble attempt to create a more accessible experience, this leads some developers to mistakenly provide the <code>role="button"</code> attribute. This overrides the implicit accessible role of <code>"link"</code> with an explicit role of <code>"button"</code>, meaning the link will be announced as a button in screen reader software. Since the linking <em>behavior</em> of loading a new page is still intact, this is deceptive and confusing for blind screen reader users and should be avoided.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- don’t do this --&gt;</span>

I suggest you maintain a separate call-to-action style for links which has more visual purchase than a standard link but which does not resemble a button.</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">a </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

For the sake of easy cognition, if links should be blue, so should buttons: blue comes to mean clickable.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>I have qualified the <code>.call-to-action</code> class with the element name <code>a</code>. You may have read elsewhere that this is redundant, but it serves an important purpose: it restricts the use of <code>.call-to-action</code> styles to the <code>a</code> element. By using <code>.call-to-action</code> on a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, or an inaccessibly interactive <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, the style will not be invoked. This effectively prevents a developer from using the wrong element for the job. In the excellent article &#8220;<a href="http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2015/11/04/how-our-css-framework-helps-enforce-accessibility/"><span class="link">How Our CSS Framework Helps Enforce Accessibility</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_14"><span class="sup_link">14</span></a></sup>,&#8221; Ian McBurnie details a number of similar provisions.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>Another way that <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s are differentiated from links is that they don&#8217;t have a <code>pointer</code> cursor style. In &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/buttons-shouldnt-have-a-hand-cursor-b11e99ca374b#.qoxbgwz15"><span class="link">Buttons shouldn&#8217;t have a hand cursor</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_15"><span class="sup_link">15</span></a></sup>,&#8221; Adam Silver explains why manually adding <code>cursor: pointer</code> to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements is a usability mistake. It is not standard behavior to invoke this cursor style on <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s, and it&#8217;s risky to break with long-held convention.</p><h3>Embrace Standard Behavior</h3><p>A second pitfall can be laid out much more succinctly: if the behavior is to link, use a link&#8217;s behavior to do it. It sounds simple when put like that, but we tend to overengineer interfaces. Client-side JavaScript frameworks especially have a habit of supplanting standard link behavior. This might help the framework developers because they like to work exclusively within the realm of JavaScript. It does not help users.</p><p>As well as basic linking behavior breaking when JavaScript is not available, even where it <em>is</em> available the experience is lacking: URLs only reveal &#8220;javascript:;&#8221; on hover and the link cannot be dragged into the browser tab list. The right-click context menu intended for links is not invoked either. A browser only knows to provide these things if you use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element in an expected way.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- this is robust and featureful --&gt;</span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now that the markup is not technically <em>nonconforming</em>, there are a number of more important UX concerns to address:</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">1. </span>The link doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated label, either visually or determinable by assistive technologies. The outcome is that users will not know they can interact with the item until they <em>interact with it</em> (by hovering the cursor over it to produce a pointer, say, or by invoking a focus style).</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">2. </span>This structure produces unexpected behaviors in some screen readers. For example, in VoiceOver, when I try to navigate to a product heading using <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Alt</em> + <em>Cmd</em> + <em>H</em>, the surrounding link is focused and the heading semantics (&#8220;Third-level heading&#8221;) are not announced.</p><p class="list"><span class="digit">3. </span>In all assistive technologies, focusing the link is liable to trigger the readout of all its textual contents, which is rather verbose.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="digit">4. </span>Operators of touch devices will undoubtedly find themselves accidentally following the link while pressing a part of the screen which <em>appears</em> to be uninteractive. Very annoying.</p><p>In general, it&#8217;s better to avoid block-level links like this one. Just because the specification mandates that something is technically valid markup doesn&#8217;t mean it produces an agreeable user experience. In his article &#8220;<a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2015/01/06/to-hell-with-compliance/"><span class="link">To Hell With Compliance</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_19"><span class="sup_link">19</span></a></sup>,&#8221; accessibility consultant and trainer Karl Groves sets out why the bureaucratic box-ticking of compliance testing gains us little ground towards successful inclusion. It&#8217;s the bare minimum we can offer. Complaints toward online services are almost always from people unable to actually <em>use</em> an interface, but a 100%-compliant interface can still be entirely unusable. By the same token, an interface with the odd superficial error may be so simple, well structured and clear that it&#8217;s still a pleasure to use.</p><p>Because so many accessibility errors relating to assistive technologies are markup errors, and because markup errors are so easy to identify, we&#8217;ve grown up in an accessibility remediation culture that is assistive technology obsessed and focused on discrete code errors.</p><p>Inclusive design has a different take. It acknowledges the importance of markup in making semantic, robust interfaces, but it is the user&#8217;s ability to <em>actually get things done</em> that it makes the object. The quality of the markup is measured by what it can offer in terms of UX.</p><h2>SERPs</h2><p>Though our product pattern is now more than satisfactory, we need to accept that our own interface is not the only way our customers will find and consume our product information. A well-indexed site will also expose products in search engine results pages, or SERPs.</p><p>The advantage of using SERPs like Google&#8217;s is that no matter the content you are searching, the interface remains the same. Notably, some assistive technology users rely heavily on Google Search because it is a prelearned interface. A common tactic is to use the <em>site:</em> prefix to return results confined to a chosen website:</p><pre><code>site:shop.the-photography-site.com [search term] </code></pre><p>We don&#8217;t have control over the aesthetic with which Google lists our content. But we do have control of the wording. For example, the listed page&#8217;s <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> doubles as the linked <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element of an individual search result. All the more reason to write descriptive, easily understood <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> text as described in &#8220;The Document.&#8221; In fact, well-written <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> text can elevate your search rankings, but <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/title-tags/#spammy-title-tags"><span class="link">avoid spammy <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>s</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_20"><span class="sup_link">20</span></a></sup>. Not only will Google penalize you, but such <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>s tend to constitute unreadable, and therefore uninclusive, content.</p><p>Since we are dealing with products, we have an opportunity to enhance our product listing using <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/"><span class="link">structured data</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_21"><span class="sup_link">21</span></a></sup>. In brief, structured data increases the meta information parsable by machines like Googlebot. It&#8217;s a little like WAI-ARIA, but for archiving rather than assistive technology support. Structured data affects the user directly since the search listing will be enhanced to include more detailed information, such as the price and rating of the product. By bringing this information to search engine results, we enhance the experience of those who choose to browse our content in this context.</p><h3>Using the Product Vocabulary</h3><p>Structured data is divided into <em>vocabularies</em> which apply to different varieties of content. For our purposes there is a <em>product vocabulary</em>, defining product-specific properties, to be found at <a href="http://schema.org/Product"><span class="link">http://schema.org/Product</span></a><sup><a href="#fn21_22"><span class="sup_link">22</span></a></sup>.</p><p>The best place to include structured data for an individual product is at its permalink page: the page &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; will take the user to see greater detail about the product and choose purchasing options. At this page, the markup will use a template which might look like this:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>main</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"main"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

As with all the patterns herein, it&#8217;s really just an excuse to hone our inclusive design chops. As in previous patterns, the organization and structure of content is paramount. However, this was the first time we looked deeply into image accessibility, from both the perspectives of alternative text composition and performance. In catering to blind consumers, those who cannot afford generous data contracts, and anyone accessing your content from <em>outside</em> your interface, it was a chance to really push the limits of inclusive design.</p><h3>Things to Avoid</h3><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Inconsistently composed or unoptimized product images.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Unhelpful or misleading alternative text.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Block-level links containing lots of text content.</p><p class="list last-item"><span
