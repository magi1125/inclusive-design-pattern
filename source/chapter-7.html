Not long into conversation you ask me what I do. I simply say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer.&#8221; Before you have the chance to ask me what <em>type</em> of designer I am, our mutual friend, the host, taps me on the elbow.</p><p>&#8220;Can I borrow you a moment?&#8221;</p><p>They make their apologies and usher me away. You&#8217;re rather relieved, actually, since the sort of person who proudly pronounces themselves &#8220;a designer&#8221; is probably a bit of a self-regarding bore. Nonetheless, you&#8217;re left briefly wondering what I actually do to pay the bills. Perhaps he makes designer egg cups? Sews postmodernist swimwear? Builds helicopter missile systems? He could have meant <em>anything</em>.</p><p>By the end of the party we&#8217;re not reacquainted, but in a conversation with our mutual friend over the phone the following day, they apologize to you again for the previous night&#8217;s interruption. After a moment, you recall.</p><p>&#8220;Oh, your friend the designer. Well, never mind. What does he actually <em>design</em> anyway?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s a web designer.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, <em>right</em>.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p><p>Now, the way you might react to this new information is really going to depend on your relationship to the sprawling, amorphous public information matrix we call The Web. If you&#8217;re more a consumer of the web than a producer <em>for</em> the web, <em>web designer</em> is probably sufficient: &#8220;OK, so they design web stuff. Websites and the like.&#8221;</p><p>But I&#8217;m willing to bet this isn&#8217;t you, otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be reading this book. In which case, you&#8217;re no doubt aware just how controversial, contested, and frequently contrary the term <em>design</em> is in the context of the web. The number of people contributing to the web at any given moment is unfathomable, and so is the variety of their talents and skills. So which ones are the designers, and what do they do?</p><p>For a long time, we&#8217;ve been getting the answers to these questions epically, tragicomically <em>wrong</em>. We&#8217;ve misconceived and mistreated the medium, both making hard work for ourselves and shortchanging our audiences as a result.</p><h2>Reconceiving Web Design</h2><p>Our most persistent error as an industry has been to apply the largely incompatible principles of <em>printed</em> graphical communication design to the web. A print designer&#8217;s domain is purely visual, confined to predictable and predetermined spaces, using agreed materials and consistently reproducible resolutions and colors. Print design is the production of static, immutable artifacts.</p><p>That&#8217;s not like the web <em>at all</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t stop us pouring wasted energy into pointless frippery like pixel perfection and organizing ourselves into those two ill-defined, arbitrary groups, designers and developers. It&#8217;s as if content editors and project managers don&#8217;t even exist!</p><p>The truth is, design work is <em>deliberation</em>. It&#8217;s the pursuit of the best solution to a given problem. By relegating design to the realm of visual aesthetics, so much of the web goes undesigned. This can only lead to inaccessibility, poor performance and, of course, a general lack of utility.</p><p>The aim of this book is to help you nurture design thinking that&#8217;s suited to the web and, as such, acknowledges some (astonishingly recent!) developments in the evolution of the web design discipline:</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>The web is made of code and must be designed, therefore designing <em>with</em> code is working with the right materials. This is the best course of action.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Content &mdash; what we <em>write</em> or otherwise <em>express</em> via the web &mdash; must be subject to design thinking and, in fact, all other design decisions should facilitate that.</p><p class="list"><span class="bullet">•</span>Web pages are not immutable artifacts. They should be tolerant of changing, dynamic content. This content should be managed in terms of discrete components which can be reused as agreed patterns.</p><p class="list last-item"><span class="bullet">•</span>The potential audience of a website or app is <em>anyone human</em>. Inclusivity of ability, preference and circumstance is paramount. Where people differ &mdash; and they always do &mdash; inclusive interfaces are robust interfaces.</p><h2>Inclusive Design</h2><p>For the subject and purpose of this particular book, that last principle is the most important. Before we can contemplate inclusive patterns, inclusive design must first be defined. It&#8217;s really more of a mindset than anything reducible to discrete skills, so I&#8217;m going to illustrate it by way of an analogy.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a property representing a street address in JSON:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token string">"address"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"84, Beacon St, Boston, MA 02108, United States"</span></code></pre><p>Now, if I wanted to print the address to screen using a templating library like Handlebars, I might write something like <code>{{this.address}}</code>. Fine, but what if I needed to refer to the country part of my address on its own? With the data in its current form &mdash; one string &mdash; I&#8217;d have to write a helper to extract the &#8220;United States&#8221; part.</p><pre><code class=" language-javascript">Handlebars<span class="token punctuation">.</span>registerHelper<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'getCountry'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>address<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">return</span> address<span class="token punctuation">.</span>split<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">','</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>pop<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>This is what some might refer to as <em>hacky</em>: a fragile and unfortunately complex workaround. A hack is a symptom of <em>bad design</em>. Not only is the employment of a helper function relatively computationally heavy, it&#8217;s also unreliable. Why? Because not all addresses end in a country. British addresses, for instance, usually end in a postcode:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token string">"address"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"85-87, Gwydir St, Cambridge, England, CB1 2LG"</span></code></pre><p>A more robust solution might be to make the address property an object and store each part of the address as a property on that object:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token string">"address"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token string">"building"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"85-87"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token string">"street"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Gwydir St"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token string">"city"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Cambridge"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token string">"country"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"UK"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token string">"zipOrPostcode"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"CB1 2LG"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Now I can access the country simply with <code>address.country</code>.</p><p>This seems like a better approach. But is it? Using a hugely international set of addresses, you&#8217;ll find they vary so much that prescribing an unbending set of properties is just not tenable. Simply capturing a single string makes more sense. You&#8217;d have to forfeit being able to extract countries, but sometimes that&#8217;s the way it goes.</p><p>In any case, thinking about the structure of data and trying to arrive at an optimal solution <em>is designing</em> and there&#8217;s not an Adobe license or copy of Sketch in sight. In fact, it&#8217;s really a kind of <em>inclusive</em> design: here, the right solution is one which is inclusive of different kinds of addresses. We&#8217;d like to be able to deal with consistent, uniform addresses, but that&#8217;s not reality. Instead, we make allowances.</p><p>Replace &#8220;structure of data&#8221; with &#8220;interface&#8221; and swap &#8220;addresses&#8221; for &#8220;people&#8221; in the previous paragraph, and you&#8217;ve got <strong>inclusive interface design</strong> in a nutshell.</p><p>The best part is that designing inclusive interfaces, like designing robust data schemas, doesn&#8217;t have to be any harder or more complex than making exclusive or otherwise obsolete ones. It&#8217;s just different. By looking at common web interface patterns through the lens of inclusivity, this book will help you quickly learn how to apply and reapply conventions that will earn you a broader and less frustrated audience.</p><h2>The Inclusive Button</h2><p>Let&#8217;s look at one more simple example, a prototypical interface pattern much like those to follow. This time, we&#8217;ll look at an interactive element, a button, from the perspectives of three types of designer. The purpose of this example is to show you how a little bit of knowledge about the medium can lead to a simpler and more inclusive solution.</p><h3>The Graphic Designer</h3><p>The first designer comes from a graphic design background. Their files never have a resolution lower than 300dpi and they have a working knowledge of color theory. Their typography and illustration skills are vivacious. To them, a button is a visual artifact, producible in Adobe Illustrator or Sketch. They are concerned with how that button resembles a real button and how it simultaneously fits into the larger design&#8217;s branding. They have no idea how to put that button on a web page or to make it do anything.</p><h3>The Designer Who Codes</h3><p>The second designer has many of the same skills exhibited by the first, but differs in one important aspect: they have enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make their button appear inside a web page, and attach a JavaScript event listener to it.</p><p>The HTML looks like this:</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span>"button"</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>and the CSS like this:</p><pre><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.button </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">width</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 200px<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">height</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 70px<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token property">background</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token url">url('../images/button.png')</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript would probably be written using jQuery or perhaps AngularJS&#8217;s API. Using the Web API (&#8220;vanilla&#8221; JavaScript), it might look a bit like this:</p>
<!-- translator_notes: 0204 -->
<pre><code class=" language-javascript">button<span class="token punctuation">.</span>addEventListener<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'click'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token comment">// the event fired on click
</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>Designer number two is a designer who has learned to code inasmuch as they&#8217;ve acquired the ability to bring their ideas to the web &mdash; to put them in web pages. Under some circumstances, they may even work for the odd user. Unfortunately, aside from the event listener, all they&#8217;re really doing is encoding graphic design, not <em>designing with code</em>. As the third designer is only too aware, there are few direct translations between graphic design and web interface design.</p><h3>The Inclusive Designer</h3><p>The third designer sees the second designer&#8217;s button from a number of perspectives, each the imagined point of view of a potential user. Accordingly, the current implementation presents a number of problems.</p><p>One problem regards the not insignificant number of users who zoom their web pages to ease reading. The image used is not a vector, so cannot be scaled without becoming degraded and blurry as a result. That&#8217;s if the user operates full page zoom. If the user adjusts their browser&#8217;s default font size independently, the image (which has been defined using pixels rather than relative units) will not scale at all.</p><p>Another problem is encountered when a user switches off image loading in their mobile browser, to save bandwidth: the button, constituted entirely by a background image, will be invisible. Users having trouble differentiating foreground and background imagery may turn on Windows&#8217; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-on-High-Contrast"><span class="link">high contrast mode</span></a><sup><a href="#fn7_1"><span class="sup_link">1</span></a></sup>. This, under some conditions, will also <a href="http://terrillthompson.com/blog/182"><span class="link">eliminate background images</span></a><sup><a href="#fn7_2"><span class="sup_link">2</span></a></sup>.</p><p>And it doesn&#8217;t stop there. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, unlike the purpose-built <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, is not (in its current form) focusable or operable by keyboard. Some folks choose to navigate and operate web pages with a keyboard. Others <em>must</em> use a keyboard, because a mouse requires a finer motor control than they can muster.</p><p>Screen reader users include those with severe vision impairments, and others who find that having a web page read out to them using a synthetic voice aids their comprehension. The second designer&#8217;s button design leaves these users entirely bereft. Most desktop screen reader users are also keyboard users, so they encounter the same problems as the previous group. In addition, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is semantically inert, offering no information non-visually that it is, indeed, a button.</p><p>Since the button&#8217;s label of &#8220;Start&#8221; is in a background image as part of CSS&#8217;s presentation layer, this too is unavailable to assistive technologies. It&#8217;s also why the button is untranslatable into different languages, making it exclude international audiences. That&#8217;s a lot of people missing out!</p><p>The inclusive designer anticipates these problems, because experience tells them that people differ, well, in lots of different ways. Far from being daunted or frustrated, they know that by exploiting standard conventions they can achieve more by doing less. In other words, they know when to design and when to employ what is <em>already designed</em> &mdash; a simple HTML button element, provided as standard by the HTML specification. Resizable, translatable, focusable, interoperable, stylable, restylable, maintainable, mutable, <em>simple</em>.</p><pre><code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>button</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Start<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Not all inclusive design solutions are as simple as choosing the right HTML element for the job. Even so, <em>combining</em> simple, standard elements and conventional structures empathetically needn&#8217;t be difficult, nor impede artistic flair: our <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> can still be presented in a near-infinite number of ways.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There are 140,737,479,966,720 combinations of hexcodes. Obviously not all of them are accessible. If only 1% of all color combinations are accessible then there are still almost 141 million combinations to choose from. This seems more than adequate to paint any bikeshed you will come across for the rest of your career.&#8221; &ndash; &#8220;<a href="http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/"><span class="link">The Veil Of Ignorance</span></a><sup><a href="#fn7_3"><span class="sup_link">3</span></a></sup>,&#8221; Adam Morse</p></blockquote><!-- translator_notes: 0242 --><p>With experience, identifying the countless <em>inclusive</em> solutions to interface design problems can become second nature. The patterns described in this book are reusable as exemplars, but mostly they&#8217;re for practice. When new problems arise, requiring different inclusive patterns to be formulated, you will have learned how to think about formulating them. You will have become an inclusive designer.</p><div class="fn_overview"><p class="separator">—</p><p id="fn7_1"><span class="fn_number">1.</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-on-High-Contrast"><span class="fn_link">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-on-High-Contrast</span></a></p><p id="fn7_2"><span class="fn_number">2.</span><a href="http://terrillthompson.com/blog/182"><span class="fn_link">http://terrillthompson.com/blog/182</span></a></p><p id="fn7_3"><span class="fn_number">3.</span><a href="http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/"><span class="fn_link">http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/</span></a></p></div></div></body></html>
